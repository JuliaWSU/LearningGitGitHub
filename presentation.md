## Why Git and GitHub: Beyond Mere version control.
I have come to think of GitHub Pull Requests as (MS Word) track changes for code. On a local resource, you can also Meld to difference your code with another person's proposed changes, or new changes.

Once code is moved to an online location, lots of other convenient GitHub integrations are possible, a lot of these integrations are relevant not just for code, but also for communication (research publication, project planning, type-setting, collaboration, and even now outreach).

GitHub is a Democratizing force and there is even now a research group called policy/government rules as code, which is part of Civic Makers Australia (kind of a volunteer open source code movement).

As I said, its possible to apply git and GitHub to diverse tasks using integrations. Although you should at least use github for regular de-centralized code sharing. You should also use GitHub for all of the convenient integrations, these include:


## Useful Non obvious things you can achieve with Git+GitHub
* Making unpublished work citable ![Zendo](https://zenodo.org/).
* Hosted dashboard deployment (heroku, streamlit).
 * When deploying a data driven dashboard app, streamlit-share and heroku listen to github hooks.

* Continuous integration
For-instance I am using .github actions to build and test software that I am socially developing.
 * Travis, CircleCI
When making a personal code portfolio, node-js automatically knows how to push to github.pages.
* Communication and dissemination:
 * When I use Overleaf to write research, overleaf is integrated with Github so you can add figures using git add *.png.
To summarize, I use GitHub for everything, and on 4 out of 7 days a week I edit some kind of markdown file on GitHub.

# Why Version Control: Efficient and convenient sharing.


<!--
* Imagine eating dinner with your family, your sister at the table requests the salt shaker from you, knowing that you could pass the salt by gently pushing it along the table, or momentarily standing up and leaning towards your sister. Instead you decide to take the salt shaker outside, and place it in the families letter box, you reason that your sister looked to be busy chewing on some potato, and you thought rather than waiting for her, under the principal of asynchronous development you should allow her to fetch the salt from the letter box from a location where items are expected to enter the house at a time when she is ready, you are aware that your decision will seem a bit rude, but your sister is a developer and you think she will understand.

You realise, that she may not be expecting to look for the salt shaker to be in the letter box, but you don't talk to her while eating, so you instead walk to the post office, so the salt shaker can be placed in a box with a label, salt shaker, and also a manual on how to use the salt shaker could be included in the postage package.

When someone wants to do code collaboration with you, you might be tempted to send them a list of the latest files over email or a messenger, that would "feel" as appropriate as directly passing a salt shaker at the kitchen table. I will argue instead that sharing a git repository is a lot more like directly passing the salt shaker at the kitchen table.-->
